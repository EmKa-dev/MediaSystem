Refactoring

# Convert DesktopClientWPF project to use .Net Core framework.

# Create a common DownloadService in place of currently used different FetcherServices
  to avoid code-duplication. [Partially done, needs refactoring]

# Refactor download methods to use System.Span<T>(.Net Core 2.1 or later) to avoid excess buffer allocations.

# Find a way to detect duplicate devices and avoid showing duplicates.

# Better exception-handling overall, but more specifically in downloading data.

# Create mock devices that includes mock-data that we can use to test file-views.

# Refactor the MusicViewer to show a single playlist instead of listing the songs in the DeviceBrowser-view.

# Add a mechanism for reporting download progress in DownloadService and displaying it.
